# Brain Tissue Segmentation using Atlas and Expectation Maximization Algorithm

This repository is for Segmentation of Brain Tissues into CSF, GM and WM. A probabilistic atlas is created from 15 T1 Weighted brain volumes which is used as the initialization for the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Dice Coefficient is used as the metric as the performance metric. The code is written in MATLAB 2018.
